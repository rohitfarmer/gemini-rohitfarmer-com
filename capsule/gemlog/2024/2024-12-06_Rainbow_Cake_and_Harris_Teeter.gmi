# Rainbow Cake and Harris Teeter

=>rainbow-cake.jpg The rainbow cake

I ordered a birthday cake for my daughter yesterday at the nearby Harris Teeter, which was supposed to follow the rainbow theme. However, since the cake decorator wasn’t there, the lady who took my order said she could only accept what was in the design catalog. So, I chose the unicorn one as it was the closest to the rainbow theme. But she also mentioned that I should come early today and talk to the decorator, so I did. I explained to the decorator that I wanted a rainbow cake, but it was not in the catalog, so I opted for the unicorn one. Then, to my delight and in a very confident tone, she said: **"If you want a rainbow cake, I will give you a rainbow cake doesn't matter if it's in the catalog."** Bless her! People like her make the day special despite its rocky start.
