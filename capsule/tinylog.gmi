Thanksgiving holidays spent well. Had a great time with friends and family over dinners. Caught up on much-needed sleep. And got some spare time to work on my passion projects that needed attention for quite some time. I did not do any black Friday shopping this year, though.

Happy Thanksgiving, USA, and every other country that celebrates it. We had an Indian-American mixed family lunch today, and we enjoyed the variety of food and spending time with the family after a long time. One of my colleagues coined a new term for our kind of lunch today: "Curkey." That's a mix of curry and turkey. We all loved it.

After a long day today, I wrote a blog post for my primary website, https://rohitfarmer.com, and cross-posted the same article here on my Gemlog. The post is a tutorial explaining how to set up a Gemini capsule/website on a Google Cloud compute instance. I re-submitted the Gemlog URL to Antenna, and it fetched and listed the title of the latest post. Related to Gemini, everything is in order.

I moved my Gemini capsule from gemini://rohit.pollux.casa to my domain gemini://rohitfarmer.com. However, the previous website is still running. I will ask Adele to delete it once I know my self-hosted setup works correctly. Like my HTTP website, this capsule runs on the same Google Cloud micro instance (free tier) via the Agate server. I am building this website using Visual Studio Code with a GemText syntax highlighter plugin. The website code/content gets uploaded to a private repository on Codeberg.
